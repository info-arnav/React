# React

This is one of my first repos, which I made while learning to program in React. I think it can be used as a reference when not interested to run the command 

```
npx create-react-app app_name
```

The execution commands are - 

```
npm init -y
npm install -D prettier
npm install -D eslint-config-prettier
npm install -D parcel-bundler
npm install -D babel-eslint eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-react
npm i -D eslint-plugin-react-hooks
```
